##My name is Jack Vincent Curtis and I'm announcing my candidacy for president.

Yes, for the United States of America. And while I am being melodramatic, I also realize that I need to distinguish myself from the field. So I'll do that the only way I know how. I have to be honest. Not just when I talk about myself. I'm going to be honest with my promises.

Because the truth is, it's a hard job to be president. There's a lot of things in the way of you getting anything done. That's by design, it's so the system can't go so far off the rails we can't find our way back. So unfortunately there just isn't much that I can promise you. Not much that I can claim to be able to do and still call myself an honest man. But I swear to you today, that if I am elected President of the United States, I will give puppies to orphans - and orphans to puppies.

It sounds like a joke, I know. Hashtag #PuppiesForOrphans, everybody laugh. But I mean this very seriously. I've never been an orphan, thank God, but I did have a puppy.

Allie Einstein Curtis. I gave her the middle name. Allie showed up with a bunch of other pups in my second-grade classroom. We all sat around in circles as the shelter volunteers passed the dog around. Allie was the runt, and when the other kids held her she was timid and quiet. When she got to me, though, she tackled me to the ground and started licking my face.

The first night we brought her home, I slept on the floor next to her so she wouldn't be alone. Got up and spent the next day playing with her, running around the yard chasing each other. I remember Allie getting tired befor I did. And the next day we did the same thing.

I couldn't play with Allie like that forever. I'd say something about how hard we make kids lives, how many obligations we give them. But the truth is Allie grew up before I did, in the way dogs do, and we drifted apart.

But for a time, Allie was my best friend. She holds that spot in my heart in a way that no one else ever can. And lonely young boys and girls need a best friend, and I can think of no one lonelier than a child without their parents.

I could show you numbers from psychology studies. I could point to the hundreds of ways dogs give us their loyalty and their service. But I won't bother with that, because the truth is you already know its a good idea.

So I'm running for president, and this is what I'm going to do. I can't promise that every orphan in the country will get a puppy, or that the orphans will be launched into happy and successful lives by this miraculous intervention. 

I will just promise you that the puppies will be well cared for, and that a lot of lonely kids will have a new best friend.

I'm not going to argue about this with anyone. I'm just going to to get it done. My name is Jack Vincent Curtis, and I'm asking you to write me in for President of the United States on Tuesday, November 8th, 2016. Because I keep my promises.
